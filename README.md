### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Thomas, noire-munich is the alias I go by on various communities. Don't get fooled though, I happen to be French.

### I code
Yup - developer, team lead, CTO, founder... whatever happened and may be in the future.
In 2021 I founded a company that uses RedwoodJS.

### I contribute
Core Team member of [@redwoodjs](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood), I have a lot of love for it, the team, the people and the mission. I will happily freelance for Redwood projects, and if I can help in any way with yours, get in touch. It can just be an idea, doesn't have to be a codebase already.

At RedwoodJS, I will mostly do:
- triage duties
- engaging with the community
- working on an undisclosed prototype.

#### You are a French speaker and wish to talk about RedwoodJS with someone with experience AND in French? Pick a link!

### Random list
- I studied psychology, journalism and "graphic novel craft".
- Self-taught. It's a bit of a lifestyle as it means exploring a lot on my own and exposing myself to the possibility of creation and its mishaps. I stay away of cars and do not drive.
- I got a duck on my profile. Reminds me of home.
- I'm voracious of european 20th century comic books, almost any genre of music and have a soft spot for gastronomy and arts (pre-raphaÃ«lites! modern art!). For a couple of years I've been reading american early fantasy authors and a couple of sci-fi masters with great delight. Antiquity is my jam. I'm also reading old chinese, japanese and roman stuff.
- I support the theory that Vincent Van Gogh was murdered.
- I enjoy posting unedited photos & drawings [here](https://www.instagram.com/noire.munich/)
